"""ProteinMPNN - a deep learning based protein sequence design software.

DESCRIPTION
    This package provides tools for modeling protein sequences using
    Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). It includes modules
    for processing protein structures, generating features, and training MPNN models.

MODULES:
- data_processing: Contains functions for preprocessing protein structure and sequence data.
- features: Contains functions for generating featres from protein structures.
- models: Contains the MPNN model architecture for inferring sequences and scoring.

FUNCTIONS:
    TODO: write docs
    run_inference(*args, **kwargs)
        Infers sequences for a given protein structure.
        Alternatively, probabilities and scores may be estimated.
